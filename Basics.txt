# Programming Language; A language to communicate with machines

# Human  ->  Programming Language   ->  Interpreter / Compiler  ->  Machine Language [Binary(0, 1)]  ->  Machine Work

# Programming Languages; Python, C / C++, JS, etc.

# Python  ->  Interpreter  ->  cpython  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    -> That's why Python is not fast as C
    -> Python is much closer to english

# C / C++  ->  Compiler  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    -> That's why C is fast 
    -> C is not much closer to english so, it is much closer to machines

# Interpreter; Reads code line by line

# Compiler; Reads whole file at a time
